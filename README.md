This project is a fully responsive e-commerce web application built with React. 
It features a multi-page layout with a Home, Shop, and Cart page, managed through React Router. 
Each product card includes dynamic quantity controls and an Add to Cart button, allowing users to adjust their selections seamlessly. 
The cart updates in real time as items are added or removed, demonstrating effective use of React state management.
A mocked API is used for product data, for flexibility of design.
The project also emphasizes modular component organization, responsive design principles, and clear navigation across devices.
